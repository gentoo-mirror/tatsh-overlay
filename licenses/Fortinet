Fortinet in writing, the warranty replacement Software is provided only to the original licensee, and is subject to the terms and
conditions of the license granted by Fortinet for the Software. The Software Warranty Period shall extend for an additional ninety (90)
days after any warranty replacement software is delivered. If Fortinet determines in its reasonable discretion that a material nonconformance is incapable of correction or that it is not practical to repair or replace the non-conforming Software, the price paid by
the original licensee for the non-conforming Software will be refunded by Fortinet; provided that the non-conforming Software (and
all copies thereof) is first returned to Fortinet. The license granted respecting any Software for which a refund is given automatically
terminates immediately upon refund. For purpose of the above hardware and software warranties, the term “functional
specifications” means solely those specifications authorized and published by Fortinet that expressly state in such specifications that
they are the functional specifications referred to in this section 6 of this Agreement, and, in the event no such specifications are
provided to you with the Software or Hardware, there shall be no warranty on such Software.
